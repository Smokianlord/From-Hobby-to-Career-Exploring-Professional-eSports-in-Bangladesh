 ### Abstract
 The eSports phenomenon, a convergence of gaming and sports, has evolved
 beyond casual recreation, establishing itself as a burgeoning professional pursuit
 globally. This transformation is particularly pronounced in Bangladesh, fueled by
 a youthful demographic and widespread internet access. This research investigates
 the motivations driving individuals to embrace eSports as a career, scrutinizing asso
ciated challenges such as societal perceptions, financial considerations, and broader
 cultural implications. Through a combination of surveys, expert interviews, and a
 comprehensive examination of 64 survey responses and in-person interviews with
 22participants, this study reveals that personal enthusiasm serves as a primary driver
 for players, despite the challenges of balancing academic and personal responsibil
ities. While skepticism persists, eSports is gaining momentum, fostering commu
nities and innovative employment opportunities. To sustain this positive trajectory,
 government support and recognition of study limitations are imperative. This study
 offers a thorough analysis of eSportsâ€™ profound impact on the socio-cultural land
scape and anticipates its future ramifications for Bangladesh. The findings con
tribute to the HCI and ICT4D communities, offering insights into the intersection of
 technology, culture, and eSports in a rapidly evolving digital nation
